When thinking of history, many great figures come to mind. Leaders and rulers, comanding vast armies and demanding the respect of other rulers from around the world.  Emperors, kings, flying knives, they all had one thing in common.  The all wore crowns.

If the head of CQP were to go around without a crown, well.  With the current head of CQP, this is no issue.  Yet we need to future-proof the department, and ensure that the head of CQP will always demand respect from other leaders - regardless of their karate skills.

To this end, the CQP crown will be created.  A construction of iron, it shall be coated with titanium nitride to give it the traditional golden look.  Based on a mathematical function, it will strike awe and respect into any whose gaze shall fall upon it.

And thus, the head of CQP shall forever be respected, revered and renowned by any kings and/or emperors they may come across.
