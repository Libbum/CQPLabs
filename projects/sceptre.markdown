A ceremony is all well and good for bringing into the fold new PhD's, Postdocs and ~~peasants~~ Undergrads, but how will we ~~strike fear~~ welcome these ~~fools~~ comrades?

![You gotta let these people know who's boss, or they'll climb all over you.](/images/crownjewells.jpg)

Brought out only for ceremonial and arse-kicking purposes, the TiN Scepture of CQP shall represent the Iron Fist of Salvy, in the most literal way possible.  Crafted from a cast of Salvy's hand, the Iron Fist brings ~~death~~ ~~discipline~~ *happiness and contendedness* to all who gaze upon it.

Or so the prophecies say.
