Amongst the academic community at RMIT, there is a tragic occurrence: a plague of procrastination; a horrific lack of that most basic human right. I speak, of course, of automatically unlocking doors.

![Finally!  I got through!](/images/hello.jpg)

The idea here is to create a device to open someone's door from *the inside* without damaging the surrounding areas (for fear of bringing down upon your head the wrath of the dreaded Property Services). This shall enable a suitably ~~lazy~~ motivated researcher to unlock their door without all that hassle of the back-breaking labour that is key turning.

There are several provisos, though:

>1. It must **not** damage anything (as stated before, but this is important).
>2. It must not interfere with the easy, manual opening of the door from the **inside**.
>3. It should be quick, and run on minimal power.
>4. It should not be a piece of duct-tape over the locking mechanism to prevent door lockage.
>5. Most important, it should be able to be engaged at a distance, with a fail-safe mechanism as well.

As you can read, this will be quite the challenge. However, we here at `CQPLαbs` will pull through, because, well.

Here at `CQPLαbs`, we care$^{*}\!$.

$^{*}$We do care. About crazy, crazy ideas and seeing them be crazy and awesome in **REAL LIFE**.
