So the main hardware component of the Chadburn project arrived today - namely an ornamental reproduction of one, shipped from some backwater part of India. Its place of origin is important in this context because apparently it's notorious for international drug trafficking via mail. So whilst it arrived swiftly and I had no issue with the sender of any kind; customs had ran the package through an x-ray and determined that there was enough reason to open the package, dismantle the E.O.T. and seize all of my cocaine. In the process they managed to break a weld inside the main mechanism so one of the handles doesn't work.

Luckily, I planned on pulling it apart and breaking it myself, so all is well (minus the $30,000 for the kilo that is).
