                <p>

                  <strong>CQPLαbs</strong> was founded over the 2013 annual Christmas breakup 
                  cricket match between staff and students of the Physics Department
                  at <a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au">RMIT</a> University. Due to the days' hot 
                  weather; liquid replenishment was in high demand. Unfortunately the water in 
                  our eskys was in its solid phase and everyone was forced to ration on beer and cider alone. 

                <p>
                  
                  As the sun went down, discussions including the awesomeness of 
                  <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> programming and 
                  the absolute necessity of a group coat-of-arms were solidified into
                  a number of projects that became more and more ridiculous. Too good
                  to lay to rest, this archive was established to document the build processes
                  required to breathe life into the finest of these drunken brain farts.
